Extraplanetary-Launchpads
=========================

About:
This is a testing release of EL with all functionality moved onto the pads.
It allows you to test EL functionality with a minimum of fuss.
Functionality can easily be moved to more appropriate parts by moving the module blocks in the part.cfg for the pads to another part.
(eg Move resource processing to a kethane processor, move resource gathering to a kethane drill)

Ore detection via Kethane mod is in, but by default in a cheaty state (it is everywhere by default).
This can be changed by editing the ExtraSpaceCenters.cfg in the Resources folder. More sensible values are commented out.

Installation:
Copy the contents of the GameData folder into KSP's GameData folder.

Optionally, copy the contents of the Ships folder into KSP's Ships folder.
Optionally, install Kethane mod 0.6 or greater. If You do not, the only way to build offworld would be to ship RocketPart resources up to your construction facility.

Usage:
To build a craft, you need the RocketParts resource plus any Fuel etc the craft contains.
Partial fuel fills are allowed.

RocketParts, Metal and Ore containers are included, courtesy of Grey's HexCans.

If you also have the Kethane mod installed (Must be version 0.6 or greater!), then the following features are enabled
Detecting and mining of Ore.
Processing of Ore into Metal.
Processing of Metal into RocketParts.
